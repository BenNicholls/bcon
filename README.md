# bcon
## A cli configuration manager for linux

If you're like me, you are too forgetful or too lazy to remember where all your configuration files are. bcon aims to help you find your config files quickly.

##Usage

Note that bcon does none of this yet. I'm just writing it down.

You have a config file. Add it to bcon

'''
bcon add filename name (tag1,tag2, etc)
'''

then later

'''
bcon name 
'''

brings up your favourite editor. Not sure what you need? Search by name or tag. ex.

'''
bcon search i3
'''

That's the gist of it.
