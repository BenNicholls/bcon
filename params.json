I'm just writing it down.\r\n\r\nYou have a config file. Add it to bcon\r\n\r\n```\r\nbcon add filename name tag1 tag2 tag3\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen later\r\n\r\n```\r\nbcon name \r\n```\r\n\r\nbrings up your favourite editor (currently hardset to be nano. Who doesn't like nano?). \r\n\r\nThe full implemented list of commands can be found with \r\n\r\n```\r\nbcon help\r\n```\r\n\r\n##FUTURE:\r\nNot sure what you need? Search by name or tag. ex.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbcon search i3\r\n```\r\n\r\n##FURTHER FUTURE:\r\n\r\nbcon will track your changes and store diffs. commands will be added to allow you to easily revert configs to a previous point in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's the gist of it. Let me know if it breaks everything, there's still lots of work to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
